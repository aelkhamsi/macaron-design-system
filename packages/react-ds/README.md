# Atomic Design System

This is an open-source project that represents a simple and lightweight library that gathers fast and customizable UI components.

We used **React** to develop the first components of the library. We plan on making these components compatible with most of the frontend frameworks in the future.

This is an on-going project. Please don't hesitate if you have any suggestions.

To run the storybook locally and explore the components:
```
npm i
npm run storybook
```
